## API Details

The chatbot is powered by the **Gemini API**, which provides dynamic market data and other real-time information for generating responses. The base URL is `https://api.gemini.com`, and it includes endpoints like `/v1/marketdata` to fetch the latest market data and `/v1/order/new` for placing simulated orders based on user commands. For full API documentation, refer to the [Gemini API Documentation](https://docs.gemini.com/).

## Customization

You can easily customize the chatbot and its appearance. The custom styles are located in the `src/styles` folder, where you can tweak the CSS or SCSS files to modify colors and design elements. To extend the chatbot's functionality, you can modify the API interaction logic in the `src/api` folder.
